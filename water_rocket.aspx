                                           <p>As we all have a desire to fly is heights to touch the skies. Hence it is the better opportunity to make your desire come true. We all know about NEWTON’S IIIrd law of motion. Now let’s put them together to focus to force a rocket into air with water and air as forcing elements and taste thrills of flight.</p>

                                         <p>Design a single stage water rocket using a plastic container preferably soft drink bottle that uses a combination of pressurized air & water for propulsion to achieve either maximum range and/or accuracy. </p>
                                         <p>Water rockets consist of three major parts the nose, body fins&nozzle. The nose and fins are the guidance system for your rocket that can increase aerodynamic stability to achieve better flight. They also add character and style to your rocket.</p>

                       <p> Volume of bottle should be less than 2litre.</p> <p>
Pressure should be less than 40psi.</p> <p>
Only water should be used as a propellant. No other gas than air is allowed to be pressurized and provide thrust to the rocket.</p> <p>
Only pressurized air & water assembly should be used for launching.</p> <p>
No other potential, kinetic, or any other form of energy will be permitted for the launch</p> <p>
Launch pad will be provided and participants can bring their own launching pad also.</p> <p>
The launcher remain must stationary on the ground while and after launching of the rocket.</p> <p>
Water rocket and any of its components should be handmade .Readymade models are strictly not allowed.</p> <p>
Your model can of any shape or size and can be made of any material but it should not damage the arena or hurt any person</p> <p>
The organizers reserve all rights to change any or all of the above rules </p> <p>
Do not use mineral water bottles as they cannot with stand pressure. Used of soft drink bottle should be preferred.</p>

<p>The place where the rocket tip fall will be considered for measuring distance from the launcher.</p>
<p>Two trials will be given to the participants and the better of the two horizontal distances (in meters) will be considered as Round 1 score.</p>
<p>Maximum of 15/20 teams (as per no. of participants) or team who cross the specific distance will qualify for the next round.</p>
